## arrayManipulation.js
This file contains two functions:
- `processArray`: Takes an array of numbers and returns a new array where each even number is squared and each odd number is tripled.
- `formatArrayStrings`: Takes an array of strings and an array of numbers processed by `processArray`, and modifies each string based on its corresponding number. It capitalizes the entire string if the number is even, and converts the string to lowercase if the number is odd.

## userInfo.js
This file contains a function:
- `createUserProfiles`: Takes an array of names and an array of modified names, and returns an array of user profile objects. Each object contains the original name, the modified name, and an auto-incremented ID starting from 1.
